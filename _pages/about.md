I am an M.S. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Korea University, under the guidance of [Prof. Yunho Oh](https://yunho-oh.github.io/).

My research interests lie in the areas of Computer Architecture and Systems, Memory Systems, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I aim to bridge the gap between computer architecture and emerging applications via algorithm-hardware co-design. Recently, I have focused on orchestrating heterogeneity in computer architecture to achieve high performance and energy-efficiency for emerging applications. My research contributions include:


* **Heterogenous Memory**: Developed a memory oversubscription-aware tensor migration scheduling for a GPU unified storage architecture [P1]. Enabled unified Flash Translation Layer (FTL) with dedicated IOMMUs and the optimized migration scheduler for hetergeneous memory-based DNN accelerator systems [P2]. Analyzed the behavior of a real CXL-based system on datacenter workloads to uncover open challenges in the emerging hardware platform [P4].
* **Heterogenous Processors**: Enabled software support for arbitrary integer formats on GPUs by software-assisted packing and load balancing between Tensor, INT and FP CUDA cores [ICPP'24]. Accelerated Yinyang K-Means via dynamic thread allocation for CPU and GPU on mobile platform [P5].
* **High Performance AI Frameworks**: Developed dynamic thread allocation for a multi-tenant GPU [ESL'24]. Enabled hardware supports for bitslice representation to process arbitrary low-precision numeric formats on GPUs [P3]. Developed memory-efficient continual learning [AAAI'25, P6].

Before I joined Korea University, I worked on developing memory-efficient continual learning frameworks with [Dr. Suhyun Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhyunk/?originalSubdomain=kr) at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in 2022 [AAAI'25, P6] and on Rowhammer mitigation with low overhead at Hanyang University in 2021 [ICCD'21]. I received my B.S. with honors from [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng) in 2021.
